# Welcome!

This is my portfolio/personal site created using Next.js and React and built on top of Vercel's "Portfolio Starter Kit" template.

I'm slowly but steadily trying to clean up any errors and traces left behind from the template, since it's quite funky (and possibly _slightly vibecoded_... oof). 

My goal is to eventually move away from deploying with Vercel and start hosting the site myself with custom domains and all that jazz! But for now... I'm focusing on mastering props and hooks.
